## Results

I have selected r2 score as the primary evaluation metric for the Sales Prediction model. And after removing the overfitted models which have r2 scores for train as 100%, we get the final list:

| Sl. No. | Regression Model      |   Train R2 (%) |   Test R2 (%) |
|:--------|:--------------------------|---------------:|--------------:|
|    1    | Linear regression       |       88.98  |      90.99 |
|    2    | Linear regression tuned       |       88.98  |      90.99 |
|    3    | Lasso regression               |       81.82 |      83.65 |
|    4    | Lasso with alpha = 0.01         |       88.98 |      91.02 |
|    5    | Ridge regression         |       88.98 |      90.93 |
|    6    | Ridge with alpha = 1         |       88.98 |      90.93 |
|    7    | Decision tree tuned         |       87.06 |      82.02 |
|    8    | Random forest         |       99.70 |      97.93 |
|    9    | Random forest tuned         |       84.24 |      84.11 |
|    10    | Gradient Boosting Regressor         |       99.87 |      98.17 |
|    11    | Gradient Boosting Regressor Tuned         |       99.58 |      95.11 |

## Conclusion

In the dynamic landscape of product and service-based businesses, the ability to forecast sales is paramount. This project, undertaken during the data science internship at Oasis Infobyte, delved into the realm of sales prediction using machine learning with Python. Let's encapsulate the key findings:

**Insights and Observations:**

1. Sales exhibit a positive correlation with both TV and Radio advertising expenses, signifying the effectiveness of these channels.
2. Notably, there's a strong correlation between TV advertising expenses and sales, emphasizing the impact of TV advertising on driving sales.
3. The R2 score, chosen as the evaluation metric, showcased the accuracy of the model in predicting sales.
4. The Gradient Boosting model emerged as the preferred choice, achieving an impressive 99% training accuracy and 98% testing accuracy.

**Key Takeaways:**

- Understanding the correlation between advertising expenses and sales aids in strategic decision-making.
- The selected model demonstrates robust predictive capabilities, laying the groundwork for effective sales planning.
- The R2 score provides a reliable indicator of the model's accuracy in forecasting sales trends.

This project not only addresses the nuances of sales prediction but also highlights the pivotal role of data science in optimizing business strategies. The findings contribute to informed decision-making, offering valuable insights for future sales initiatives.
